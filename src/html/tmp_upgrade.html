    <strong>Action Required!</strong>

    <p>
        Due to a policy enforcement by Google, the previous New Tab Override functionality had to be removed as it no
        longer complies with their developer guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, your current configuration that overrides the New Tab page is affected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To restore the expected behavior, please configure the updated solution available in the extensionâ€™s settings.
